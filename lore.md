# Lore of the Witch Calendar

*Also known as the Calendar of Witchmothers*

## Seasons

A year has four Seasons: Winter, after the Winter Solstice; Spring, after the Spring Equinox; Summer, after the Summer Solstice; and Autumn, after the Autumn Equinox. Seasons are exactly their own length, and their sum is by definition a year. Thus, no leap seconds are necessary. Each Season has a holiday when it begins, called *Recognition* (ex: *Recognition of the Summer Solstice*). The year begins with the Winter Solstice.

## Months

A year has up to thirteen Months, or Named Moons. Each lasts one lunar month, such that there are approximately three Months in each Season. The first Named Moon of the year begins on the first day of the New Moon after the Winter Solstice. Because `365 % 12 != 0`, a thirteenth Month sometimes occurs, making up the difference if necessary. Each Month has a holiday that is celebrated on the first day of its Full Moon. This holiday is called the Festival of the {name}, such as the *Festival of the Jester*.

1. Jester: Deep in the cold of Winter, we remember the purpose of joy. We tell stories and jokes, and share food and joy, because no long night nor frigid sky can prevent laughter, because we can carry mirth with us even into the darkest realms.
2. Wizard: Beset by snow and ice, we remember the work, especially the cleverness, that community takes. The roads, the houses, the meals, the medicine, the love and the care, which only our ingenuity preserves against decay and entropy.
3. Diviner: As Winter recedes and Spring glimmers, we remember the strength of spirit that community takes: the love, the faith, the care, the reflection, the growth, and the willful choices.
4. Monarch: While the climate rouses its domain from wintry slumber, we remember the splendor and sensitivity of dominion. What are we responsible for, or want to be? What inspires us to exert authority, and how can we administer it wisely?
5. Steward: As resurgent ecosystems blossom and thrive, we remember our impact and influence. What helps us thrive? How can one align their influence to help their world blossom?
6. Hierophant:
7. Lover:
8. Ranger:
9. Guardian:
10. Hermit:
11. Trader:
12. Nomad:
13. Corpse:

The day before the first day of the Jester's New Moon is called the *Conclusion*, and occurs either during the Nomad's or the Corpse's Moon. This is when the cycle of months restarts, and is named and enacted differently based on what month it occurs in:

- Nomad's Conclusion: *The Return*: An end of wandering, a time of solidarity and compassion. The wanderer comes home, or finds one, or builds one. Reflect on how you have changed, and the journey that remains.
- Corpse's Conclusion: *The Demise*: An end of suffering, a time of loss and grief. The dead return to soil, the gone live on in memory. Reflect on mortality, ephemerality, and longing.

Customarily, one celebrates both with feasting, but, so to say, the vibes are very different.

## Time

Each day lasts from sunrise to sunrise, and is divided into two ten-hour periods: ten for daytime, ten for nighttime. The length of these hours will change over the course of the year as daylight grows and shrinks. Between the hours of 0 and 10, there is daylight; between 10 and 20, there is none.

Hours are further divided into 100 minutes, and minutes into 100 seconds. A timestamp is thus expressed as `HH:MM:SS` or `08:43:94`. Like hours, the length of minutes and seconds is elastic to the time of year.

Notable hours:
- 00: sunrise
- 05: noon
- 10: sunset
- 15: midnight

Compared to calendars which switch days overnight, this calendar switches in the morning at sunrise.
