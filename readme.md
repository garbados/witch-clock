# Witch Clock

Tool for computing dates around solstices and equinoxes, answering questions like, "How many days until the Summer Solstice?"

witch-clock concerns itself with solstices and equinoxes. For more witchy star shit, check out [astronomia](https://www.npmjs.com/package/astronomia).

## Install

As a library: `npm install witch-clock`

As a CLI: `npm install -g witch-clock`; access via `witch-clock`

## Usage, library

## Usage, interpersonal

witch-clock expresses dates like "VE-80" or "SS+12" but telling your friend "it's vee-ee eighty" can be hard to say and easily misheard. So I say it a lil differently:

- VE: "vern", SS: "sum", AE: "auto", WS: "win"
- "-": "sub", "+": "plus"

So "VE-80" becomes "vern sub eighty". Of course, that won't make sense either to someone who doesn't understand the format. "Oh, I mean, eighty days til the vernal equinox."
